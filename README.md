![Using dev tools](./docs/using%20chrome%20dev%20tools.png) ![Small screen testing](./docs/Small%20screen%20testing.png)

The site remains responive across multiple screen sizes

On smaller screen sizes the hero image appeared streched and pixelated. I found a solution using css background on Stackoverflow. Link in credit sections

The gallery images were not displaying properly on smalller screens. Found a  solution on Youtube using a flexbox. Link in credit section.
